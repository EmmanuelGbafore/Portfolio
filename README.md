## 📌 Credit & Modifications

This project is based on a **tutorial by [Ali Ahmad](https://www.youtube.com/@ali_ahmad)**.  
I have **extended and customized** it by:
- Performing statistical tests (t-test, ANOVA, regression)
- Conducting predictive modeling (random forest classification)
- Creating custom Power BI visuals
- Packaging the project with SQL, Python, and documentation for real-world client use
